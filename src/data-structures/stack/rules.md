# Stack

A stack is a fundamental data structure with a very simple and strict set of rules. It operates on the last-in, first-out principle.

## Methods

Push: To add a new element, you can only push it onto the top of the stack.

Pop: To remove an element, you can only pop the one currently at the very top.

Peek or Top: You can look at the element at the top of the stack without removing it.

isEmpty: You can check if the stack is empty.
