# Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. Instead, each element is a separate object, called a node, that contains data and a reference to the next node in the sequence.

## Methods

Add: An element is added to the end of the list.

Remove: An element is removed from the list, starting at the head and traversing until the element is found.

Find: Find an element in the list by traversing through the list.

Get Size: The number of nodes in the list.
